Simplistic implementation of an ASL symbol detection tool to develop computer vision skills using OpenCv and Mediapipe. Project involving the creation of a dataset using a camera, the conversion of these images into a json file and finally the implementation of a model to process and evaluate the images in order to classify them. Still in progress on the part of modeling image data in matrix form into a matrix that can be exploited by a CNN model.
